# About me

---

As a dedicated Master's student in Bioinformatics at Pompeu Fabra University and Data Science at the University of San Francisco, I am passionate about leveraging data to drive insights in the field of bioinformatics. I am actively building a portfolio that combines coding expertise with research, featuring projects in bioinformatics, data science, computer science, and data engineering.

I would love to apply advanced analytical techniques to understand complex biological data and contribute to impactful research. I am currently furthering my education in the field of Data Science. My goal is to transition into the industry as a Bioinformatics Scientist, where I can utilize my skills in data analysis, programming, and scientific research to solve real-world challenges in genomics and biotechnology.
